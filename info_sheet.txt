Lecture section:  CS1501

Recitation day and time:  Friday 2:00-3:00pm

Assignment #:  2

Program due date:  Oct 17,2015

Handed in date:  Oct 17

Source code file name(s):
MyLZW.java 






Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?:No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
Do Nothing Mode and Reset Mode encode and decode correctly.
My Monitor encoding part seems wrong. It takes unusual time to encode “all.tar” file and generate more large size than original file. And my decoding part of Monitor mode fails too.
